# REAL-TIME-MICRO-KERNEL-PROJECT


In this project, we received a crude code and completed it respected to the pseudocode that
given has been given to us. We use IAR embedded workbench for arm environment and C
programming language to write our code. The aim of this course, and of course the project, was
to understand how real-time operating systems are built, tested, and developed.
This project based on three categories:
1. Task Administration
2. Inter-Process Communication
3. Timing Functions
We used linked lists to create
1. Ready List: carries tasks that are ready for execution
2. Waiting List: carries tasks blocked from execution and waiting for some resources
3. Timer List: carries tasks sleeping for a specific duration.
We also used linked lists for mailboxes, which is related to Inter-Process Communication.
Every other thing that needed to create an RTMK given to us. Assembly codes, list structures,
testing files, etc.
At the end of each category, we tested our code with testing files. If there is a problem, it was
easy to spot thanks to that files.
